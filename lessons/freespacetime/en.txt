It is nice to have freedom. Freedom to go anywhere you want. Freedom to do what you want.

In another hand...

Humans are limited by their environment. Environment is like a cage.

We are limited by the space we live in. Space we know. Space we are able to access. We can access so small space. Our planet is a tiny dot in a hudge univerce.

We are limited by time. Time we can live is up to about 100 years. Vast majority of us will not reach even this limit.

We can move in space with limited speed. We can focus our attention on limited number of objects.

How can we use our time efficiently? How we can use our space efficiently? Can use our space/time with maximum profit? How to do that?
