My supplier will bring me the goods today. I have to pay the supplier. I have to pay the supplier for the goods. I will pay - he is a good supplier.

I place purchase order now. I placed purchase orders to more than 20 suppliers. Now I have to organize my purchase orders. I will append purchase orders into my computer program.

My customers place sale orders. I love sale orders. I know - I get a sale order - I can earn money. My customers don't like sale orders. They place sale orders - they loose money.

Lets talk about production. Production of socks takes a lot of time. I don't like to be in the factory during production process. But I have to check if production goes well.

Our machines work day and night. We have 3 shifts per day. It is noisy when our machines work. The machines consume electricity too. I have to pay the electric bill. I have to pay the workers.

How do we store our ready goods? We put them on rafts. We let them catch dust. We like our products dusty. Dusty products look antique.

Now, lets talk about our company staff. You know? I have a secretary. I have a bookkeeper. I have 2 engineers. I have 6 technichians. I have 12 salepersons. It is a lot of money when is salary day.

The bookkeeper counts the money. The engineers draw projects. The technicians fix the machines. The salepersons sell our goods. The secretary does secret job.

So, it is a lot of fun to work in our company.
