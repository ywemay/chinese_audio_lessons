I like electronics.

I like transistors. I like resistors, capacitors, diodes, coils, switches, microcircuits.

Resistors are used to limit the electric current flow.
Capacitors are used to store electric charge. Capacitors can be used to filter current fluctuations.
Capacitors can be electrolitic with positive and negative wire.
Capacitors can be of ceramic type.

Diodes limit the current flow to one direction only.
Diodes can be used to form a diode bridge.
Diode bridge is used to transform alternating current into direct current. Diodes have 2 legs, 2 pins.

Tranzistors and diodes are made of the similar material. Transistors have 3 pins: base, collector, emittor. Transistors are the basic components of today's electronics. Transistors work by amplifying the current.

Microcircuits or microcontrollers are complex electronic parts containing microscopic parts. In their circuit can be found lots of tranzistors, rezistors, capacitors, diodes.

Transformers are used to change the voltage of an alternative current circuit. For example: from 220 volt to 5 volt. Transformer usually has 2 coils. Each coil has different number of windings. Each coil may have different type of wire thickness.

Light emitting diodes come in different colors: red, green, yellow, blue, white. Our diplays are based on light emitting diodes. If you look under the microscope at the computer monitor surface - you can see individual light emitting diodes.
