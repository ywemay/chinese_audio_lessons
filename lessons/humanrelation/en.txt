I respect him. He respects me. I respect her too. We respect each other.

I know he trusts me. He knows I trust him. We trust each other.

I have a relation with him. He has a relation with me. Our relation is borring.

I am borred too to do the same thing every day.

Now, I will find something to do - a hobby. I hobby might save me from borring time.

No need to complain about everything. To complain time to time is ok. But, do not complain all the time. You know - no one likes complains.

If you are borred we can go to travel. We can travel the world. We can go to some island. We can travel by airplane.

I also want to visit Tailand and France. Russia is good to see too.

I am not naive. I know travel costs money - I am not naive.

I am aware of consequences. And shall be consequences - I know.
So, I respect that you trust me. 

I respect that you tell me you are borred. I understand you are borred by our relation. I will not complain.

I go to travel. And - yes - I am aware of consequences.
