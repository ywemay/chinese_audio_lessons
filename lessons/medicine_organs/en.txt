I have a hard medical condition. My head pains.

I have stones in the kidney. I have stones in liver. My liver is inflated.

Perhaps I need an medical operation. Need to ask a surgeon.

My lungs pain. I cannot breath well.

Also, my stomach is not working well.

I cannot hear. I cannot hear what people say.

I cannot see well. I need eyeglasses. I cannot see anything.

On my skin have small red dots. Spider bites - I think.

I feel weak. I feel very weak. All the time want to sleep.

I also need to fix my teethes. I need a dentist.

I will see all possible doctors.
