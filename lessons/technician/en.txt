I am technician.

Give me the players. Give me the hummer. Give me the screwdriver. Give me the sandpaper. Give me the brush.

I use cutters to cut wire. I use hummer to hummer the nails. I use the screwdriver to screw the screws. And the brush I use to clean the dust.

I can work with the welder. I can weld wire together.

I use a drill to make holes in the wood and plastic. My drill has batteries. My drill can rotate clockwise and back. For my drill I use drill bits. Drill bits come in different sizes.

Sometimes I use hummer-drill. Hummer-drill is a powerfull machine. Hummer-drill can make holes in very stron materials.

Sometimes I use a jigsaw. I jigwas is handy to cut placage.

I have a toolbox where I keep my tools. I have one more box where I keep the screws, nail, connectors, switches and many other small parts.

In my toolbos I have wrenches. I have different size wrenches.

If you need my help. Well, better do not.
