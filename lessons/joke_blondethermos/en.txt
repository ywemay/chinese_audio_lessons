A blonde notices that her coworker has a thermos, so she asks him what it's for. He responds, "It keeps hot things hot. And keeps cold things cold."

The blonde immediately buys one for herself. The next day, she goes to work and proudly displays it.

Her coworker asks, "What do you have in the thermos?"

She replies, "Soup and ice cream."
