Software robots, in a nutshell, are new and flexible robots. It can be driven by air. It can also be driven by special smart materials.
In software robots as long as the core component sensing drive is made of a flexible material, it can be called a software robot. What is the difference between good and flexible materials? In fact, the hardness of the material is classified. Each material can withstand different pressures. Involutes the hardness of all materials in nature. This figure has its corresponding value. Scientists define the dividing line between soft robots and rigid robots as the 10th 9th Pascal. Therefore, most robots are composed of 9th-pascal material with a hardness of less than 10. We can define it as a software robot. So, what is the concept of the 10th 9th Pascal? In simple terms, it is slightly higher than the pressure that human tendons can withstand. At present, silicone rubber is the most common material in the software robot we can see. Its value is approximately 10 to the 7th pascal. This is very similar to the hardness of the balloons in our lives. When it comes to software robots we naturally think of traditional rigid robots. In fact, the difference between the two is mainly reflected in structural materials and controls.
