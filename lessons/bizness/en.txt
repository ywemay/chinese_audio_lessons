So many people ask today the question: "How to make money?"
Many would answer: "Open your own business."

So, what can one do? Open a factory? Start production of goods? Provide services? Or simply trade with goods produces by others?

To open a factory and have production is not simple.
Need to start by having some customers ready to buy your goods. Raw materials shall be supplied in time. Production schedule shall be respected. And if you plan to ship the goods aboard - things become complicated.

A serious company needs to process inventory efficiently. The warehouse shall be well planned. Perhaps need to have at least two warehouses. One warehouse for raw materials. And another warehouse for ready goods.

The production is quite complex too. Need to ensure sufficient space for smooth operation. So, you will have to invest in a big building. The machines shall be carefully selected and installed. Then the machines may require maintenance. 

You will need to recruit workers, unless your machines are not fully autonomus.

You will need an office too. Will have to hire office workers. The office workers shall handle the promotion of the goods, handle the documents.

Anyway. To make a big profit - hard work is required.
